        "content": "\"One very familiar type of song is the Christmas carol, although it is perhaps a bit out of season at this time. However, I am informed by my disk jockey friends, of whom I have none, that in order to get a song popular by Christmas time you have to start plugging it well in advance, so here it goes. It's always seemed to me, after all, that Christmas, with its spirit of giving, offers us all a wonderful opportunity each year to reflect on what we all most sincerely and deeply believe in - I refer, of course, to money. And yet, none of the Christmas carols that you hear on the radio, or in the street, even attempts to capture the true spirit of Christmas as we celebrate it in the United States, that is to say the commercial spirit. So I should like to offer the following Christmas carol for next year as being perhaps a bit more appropriate.\"\r\n\r\nChristmas time is here, by golly,\r\nDisapproval would be folly.\r\nDeck the halls with hunks of holly,\r\nFill the cup and don't say when.\r\n\r\nKill the turkeys, ducks and chickens,\r\nMix the punch, drag out the Dickens.\r\nEven though the prospect sickens,\r\nBrother, here we go again.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day you can't get sore,\r\nYour fellow man you must adore.\r\nThere's time to rob him all the more\r\nThe other three hundred and sixty-four.\r\n\r\nRelations, sparing no expense, 'll\r\nSend some useless old utensil,\r\nOr a matching pen and pencil.\r\n(\"Just the thing I need, how nice!\")\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter how sincere it is,\r\nNor how heart felt the spirit,\r\nSentiment will not endear it,\r\nWhat's important is the price.\r\n\r\nHark, the Herald Tribune sings,\r\nAdvertising wondrous things.\r\nGod rest ye merry merchants,\r\nMay ye make the Yuletide pay.\r\nAngels we have heard on high,\r\nTell us to go out and buy!\r\n\r\nSo, let the raucous sleighbells jingle,\r\nHail our dear old friend Kris Kringle,\r\nDriving his reindeer across the sky.\r\nDon't stand underneath when they fly by.\r\n",

Know, you have trod on the toe \r\nOf Abdul Abulbul Amir.\" \r\n\r\n\"So take your last look at the sunshine and brook \r\nAnd send your regrets to the Czar; \r\nBy this I imply you are going to die, \r\nMr. Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.\" \r\n\r\nQuoth Ivan, \"My friend, your remarks, in the end, \r\nWill avail you but little, I fear, \r\nFor you ne'er will survive to repeat them alive, \r\nMr. Abdul Abulbul Amir!\" \r\n\r\nThen this bold mameluke drew his trusty chibouque \r\nWith a cry of \"Allah Akbar!\" \r\nAnd with murderous intent, he ferociously went \r\nFor Ivan Skavinsky Skivar. \r\n\r\nThen they parried and thrust and they side-stepped and \r\ncussed \r\n'Till their blood would have filled a great pot. \r\nThe philologist blokes, who seldom crack jokes, \r\nSay that hash was first made on that spot. \r\n\r\nThey fought all that night, 'neath the pale yellow moon; \r\nThe din, it was heard from afar; \r\nAnd great multitudes came, so great was the fame \r\nof Abdul and Ivan Skivar. \r\n\r\nAs Abdul's long knife was extracting the life - \r\nIn fact, he was shouting \"Huzzah!\" - - \r\nHe felt himself struck by that wily Kalmuck, \r\nCount Ivan Skavinsky Skivar. \r\n\r\nThe sultan drove by in his red-breasted fly, \r\nExpecting the victor to cheer; \r\nBut he only drew nigh to hear the last sigh \r\nOf Abdul Abulbul Amir. \r\n\r\nCzar Petrovich, too, in his spectacles blue \r\nRode up in his new crested car. \r\nHe arrived just in time to exchange a last line \r\nWith Ivan Skavinsky Skivar. \r\n\r\nA loud-sounding splash from the Danube was heard \r\nResounding o'er meadows afar; \r\nIt came from the sack fitting close to the back \r\nOf Ivan Skavinsky Skovar. \r\n\r\nThere's a tomb rises up where the blue Danube flows; \r\nEngraved there in characters clear; \r\n\"Ah stranger, when passing, please pray for the soul \r\nOf Abdul Abulbul Amir.\" \r\n\r\nA Muscovite maiden her lone vigil keeps, \r\n\"Neath the light of the pale polar star; \r\nAnd the name that she murmurs as oft as she weeps \r\nIs Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.

(Repeat last line in each verse.)\r\n\r\nI remember one day in the park, his tally rose by four,\r\nAn enviable score he was amassing,\r\nTwo rather pleased and patient Poodles and an outraged Labrador\r\nAnd a Wombat who just happened to be passing.\r\nI tried a hundred ways to curb his carnal appetite,\r\nKept him on a lead on day, locked him up at night.\r\nI even put some bromide in his chunky meaty-bites!\r\nBut the only thing that might have worked was Kryptonite.\r\n\r\nThen came the fateful morning when he tried to consummate\r\nA liaison with a St. Bernard called Blodwyn.\r\nAnd even though he was quite clearly fighting well above his weight\r\nHe didn't let that minor detail stop him.\r\nHe nearly pulled it off, oh, what an acrobat,\r\nBut Blodwyn got bored and down she sat.\r\nThey say that after making love you often feel quite flat,\r\nI'm sure that Little Gomez would agree with that.\r\n\r\nSo I buried Gomez in the park, his happy hunting ground,\r\nA sad but fitting finale.\r\nI had to dig a grave that was rather long and round,\r\n'Cause he looked like a squashed tamale.\r\nBut I really missed my wee Chihuahua chum,\r\nSo I went down to the pet shop to buy another one,\r\nI went in feeling happy, but I came out feeling glum,\r\nBecause the man down at the pet shop loved corny puns!\r\n\r\nCODA: And he said:\r\nYes, we have no Chihuahuas,\r\nWe have no Chihuahuas today.\r\nWe've Alsatians, Dalmatians,\r\nAnd the fruits of a flirtation\r\nBetween a half-blind Pekinese and a toupee.\r\nBut yes, we have no Chihuahuas,\r\nWe have no Chihuahuas today.

But the nicest thing about a protest song is that it makes you feel so good.

Among the things they did, in an attempt to make the church more... commercial, was to introduce the vernacular into portions of the Mass to replace Latin, and to widen somewhat the range of music permissible in the liturgy. But I feel that if they really want to sell the product in this secular age, what they ought to do is to redo some of the liturgical music in popular song forms. I have a modest example here; it's called The Vatican Rag!\"\r\n\n\r\n\nFirst you get down on your knees,\r\n\nFiddle with your rosaries,\r\n\nBow your head with great respect,\r\n\nAnd genuflect, genuflect, genuflect!\r\n\n\r\n\nDo whatever steps you want if\r\n\nYou have cleared them with the Pontiff.\r\n\nEverybody say his own\r\n\nKyrie eleison,\r\n\nDoin' the Vatican Rag.\r\n\n\r\n\nGet in line in that processional,\r\n\nStep into that small confessional.\r\n\nThere the guy who's got religion'll\r\n\nTell you if your sin's original.\r\n\nIf it is, try playin' it safer,\r\n\nDrink the wine and chew the wafer,\r\n\nTwo, four, six, eight,\r\n\nTime to transubstantiate!\r\n\n\r\n\nSo get down upon your knees,\r\n\nFiddle with your rosaries,\r\n\nBow your head with great respect,\r\n\nAnd genuflect, genuflect, genuflect!\r\n\n\r\n\nMake a cross on your abdomen,\r\n\nWhen in Rome do like a Roman;\r\n\nAve Maria,\r\n\nGee, it's good to see ya.\r\n\nGettin' ecstatic an' sorta dramatic an'\r\n\nDoin' the Vatican\r\n\nRag!\r\n",
